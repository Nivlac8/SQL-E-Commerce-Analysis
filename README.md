# US Superstore Sales Analysis

## Project Overview
I analyzed a dataset of US Superstore sales to identify the most profitable product categories and top-performing regions.

## Key Questions Answered
1. Question 1: "Which Product Category is making us the most profit?"
    Why ask this: We need to know what to sell (Furniture vs. Tech).
2. "We want to cut shipping costs. Which shipping mode is used the most?"
    Why ask this: To negotiate better rates with FedEx/UPS.
3. "Who are our Top 5 Customers by total spending?"
    Why ask this: To send them special coupons (VIP retention).
